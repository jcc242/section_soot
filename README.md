This is starting off as a fortran port of the [Discrete Sectional Code](https://github.com/chenxi20JT/discrete-sectional-code/tree/master), which was written in support of their paper:

Chenxi Li, Runlong Cai, Tutorial: The discrete-sectional method to simulate an evolving aerosol, Journal of Aerosol Science, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105615.
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002185022030104X)

See some more of my notes, which are again a shameless rip from the cited paper, [here](section_soot.md).

I wrote this code to be compiled by the [Fortran Package Manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/index.html). 
You can install fpm on Macbooks using conda forge (the free/open source version of Andaconda, using the license-free repositories). 
Once installed, in the same directory as this README, run `fpm run` to run the main program located in the app/ directory. 
You can also run `fpm test` to run the test cases located in the test/ directory. 
The test runner is [test-drive](https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive), which will be automatically installed by fpm when you run the tests. 

The documentation is generated by [FORD](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
FORD can be installed on Macbooks using your local python installation with pip.
