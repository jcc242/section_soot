This is starting off as a fortran port of the [Discrete Sectional Code](https://github.com/chenxi20JT/discrete-sectional-code/tree/master), which was written in support of their paper:

Chenxi Li, Runlong Cai, Tutorial: The discrete-sectional method to simulate an evolving aerosol, Journal of Aerosol Science, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105615.

See some more of my notes, which are again a shameless rip from the cited paper, [here](section_soot.md).
